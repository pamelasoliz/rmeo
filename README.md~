The following project will show the navigation of a mobile robot (rmeo) thanks to the package mybot_ws-master that can be found in the following link: https://github.com/richardw05/mybot_ws. 
It will also show how the mobile robot (rmeo) by adding a goal goes from point A to point B using the appropriate libraries.
The idea of ​​the project was that the mobile robot had to evade obstacles and go to a desired point. using Arduino Mega 2560 and Raspberry Pi 3 as you will see in the following figure the assembly made in SolidWorks.


It was not possible to make the arduino load the code done in ino ((code made by us) and in the installation of ros in the raspberry due to bad image copy problems.
so a simulation will be shown in which you can only see a map made by us thanks to the aforementioned package, in the folder mybot_codigo you will see the code sent by the goal.
